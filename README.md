# ASIC RTL-to-GDS Implementation and Comparative Analysis of 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) and Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete ASIC design flow by implementing and comparing two widely used digital adder architectures: a **4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** and a **4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**.

Both designs were developed using **Verilog HDL** and implemented through the complete **RTL-to-GDSII** flow using the **Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK)** and the **OpenLane** open-source ASIC design toolchain.

The project provides hands-on experience with every major stage of the ASIC physical design process, including RTL design, simulation, synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, timing analysis, physical verification, and GDSII generation.
